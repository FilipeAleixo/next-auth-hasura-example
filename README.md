Required:

- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

# Setting up Hasura

### To launch Hasura for development

> For the first time:

```sh
cd hasura
make jwt
# it will copy .env.example to .env and create JWT token inside your .env
```

> Then

```sh
cd hasura
docker-compose up -d
# will launch postgres and Hasura containers
make console
# Will start Hasura console and tracking change (metadata/migrations) from the GUI.
```

### Regroup your Hasura changes

> Every action on your postgres tables will create a migration folder with timestamps and the sql code, you can merge these with the squash command.

```sh
hasura migrate squash --name 'squash-given-name' --from '{your older timestamps folder}'
```

> Testing migrations

To test you newly created migrations what you can do is to reproduice a fresh install. To do so you can create a new repo and git clone this repo and copy your migrations but you will have to change the network Id and the db name inside your docker-compose.yaml, or you can delete your db without the need to create a new repo.

```sh

# Clean up Docker
cd /hasura
docker-compose down
docker volume ls
#... see the one you want to remove maybe "hasura_db_..."
docker volume rm name_of_your_volume
# now you can docker-compose up and do the migration (metadata and migrations)
```

## ðŸš€ Deployment

> Hasura: use the hasura cli with the `Makefile`

```sh
# for your local or staging (not prod)
make migrate
```

> Track all tables and relationships

Click `Track all` both for the tables and the relationships

# Setting up front-end
